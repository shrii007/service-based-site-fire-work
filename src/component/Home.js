Commercial security devices issue  a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a fire alarm system, while household smoke detectors, also known as smoke alarms, generally issue a local audible or visual alarm from the detector itself or multiple detectors if there are more than one interlinked. <br />

          According to the US National Safety Council (NSC), the leading causes of home fires and injuries are cooking and heating. This is why fire safety at home should be prioritized by practicing safety tips and protocols when using electrical appliances, cooking equipment, and others that may be fire hazards. On another note, 2021 data from the US Fire Administration states that 116,500 non-residential building fires led to 1,025 injuries and 115 deaths. This is just one reason why fire safety in the workplace must be implemented to mitigate the negative business impacts of fire-related incidents.</p>

          Moreover, fire safety is of paramount importance for the following reasons:
